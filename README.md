# 🛗 Lift Simulation System  

## 📌 Project Overview  

The **Lift Simulation System** is a Python-based application that simulates the real-world working of an elevator (lift). The system allows users to select floors, move the lift up or down, and manage floor requests using logical conditions and structured programming.  

This project demonstrates strong understanding of **Python programming, control flow, and real-world system simulation**.
